# Habit Tracker Project Cleanup and Verification Plan

## 1. Code Analysis and Cleanup
- Review frontend and backend code for:
  - Unused imports, variables, functions
  - Redundant or duplicate code
  - Debugging statements (console.log, alerts) to remove
  - Consistent code style and formatting
- Remove any unnecessary files or assets not used in the project
- Verify dependencies in package.json files; remove unused dependencies

## 2. Functional Verification
- Verify all frontend pages and components render correctly:
  - Auth page
  - Dashboard
  - Friends Feed
  - Add Friends
  - Leaderboard
- Verify backend API endpoints respond correctly and handle errors:
  - Auth routes (register, login, getMe)
  - Habit routes (CRUD, complete, progress)
  - User routes (leaderboard, search, follow, feed)
  - Notification routes (daily reminders)
- Check integration between frontend and backend (API calls)

## 3. Testing
- Perform critical-path testing:
  - User registration and login
  - Creating, editing, deleting habits
  - Completing habits and viewing progress
  - Adding and following friends
  - Viewing leaderboard and friends feed
- Optionally perform thorough testing covering all edge cases and error scenarios

## 4. Documentation
- Verify README.md includes:
  - Project overview
  - Setup and installation instructions
  - How to run frontend and backend
  - API endpoint documentation
  - Testing instructions
- Add or update comments in code for clarity

## 5. Final Review and Cleanup
- Run linting and fix any issues
- Run build scripts to verify production readiness
- Remove any leftover debug or test code
- Confirm all functionality works as expected
